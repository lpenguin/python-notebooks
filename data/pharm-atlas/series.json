Oncogenic mutation in BRAF gene is the single most frequent genetic alteration in human melanoma; however, this event per se is not sufficient to produce melanoma in vivo. We have investigated whether epigenetic changes, specifically aberrant DNA methylation and dysregulation of gene expression, alone or in combination with this genetic event, are involved in the genesis of human melanoma. We have constructed the whole \u2018\u2018of primary human melanomas in relation to their BRAF mutational status. Our methylation profiling identified a large number of hyper- or hypomethylated genes in melanoma tumors, many of which being novel and having the potential to serve as biomarkers. Gene ontology analysis revealed that gene categories involved in neuronal cell morphology and development, and skin and neurological disorders were highly enriched. Frequently methylated targets included developmental regulatory transcription factors and homeobox genes, which are mostly subjected to bivalent histone marking and Polycomb occupancy in embryonic stem cells. Notably, several genes involved in the MEK-ERK and the PI3K pathways, two of the most frequently perturbed pathways in human melanoma, showed extensive methylation changes. Gene expression profiling identified a long list of dysregulated genes, many of which being involved in melanocytes development and differentiation, and showing concomitant aberrant DNA methylation. Sub-typing of the melanoma tumors based on BRAF mutational status revealed that tumors with a mutated BRAF had distinctive and more pronounced changes in both DNA methylation and gene expression profiles than tumors carrying the wildtype BRAF. The differentially compromised methylome and transcriptome of melanomas (dependent on BRAF mutation) deserves special attention because many epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation-mediated regulation of gene expression, are potentially reversible. The dichotomous integrity of epigenome in human melanoma holds great promise for the field of personalized medicine.", "meta": {"geo_id": 31879}, "type": ["Methylation profiling by genome tiling array", "Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1315267200000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "Moffitt Cancer Center", "Country": "USA", "State/province": "FL", "Zip/postal_code": "33647", "City": "Tampa", "Street address": "12902 Magnolia Drive", "Name": "Dung-Tsa Chen"}, "accession": "GSE29621", "overall_design": "mRNA was extracted from  colon tissues for microarray analysis", "title": "mRNA and microRNA profile in colon cancer [mRNA data]", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA153829"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a41ca1385777d5122460"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM734135", "GSM734136", "GSM734122", "GSM734124", "GSM734140", "GSM734125", "GSM734175", "GSM734153", "GSM734168", "GSM734114", "GSM734130", "GSM734174", "GSM734126", "GSM734112", "GSM734128", "GSM734138", "GSM734151", "GSM734145", "GSM734117", "GSM734144", "GSM734115", "GSM734150", "GSM734132", "GSM734167", "GSM734156", "GSM734163", "GSM734164", "GSM734119", "GSM734146", "GSM734129", "GSM734131", "GSM734111", "GSM734120", "GSM734134", "GSM734148", "GSM734155", "GSM734166", "GSM734160", "GSM734139", "GSM734133", "GSM734162", "GSM734113", "GSM734118", "GSM734161", "GSM734165", "GSM734152", "GSM734172", "GSM734173", "GSM734137", "GSM734142", "GSM734116", "GSM734121", "GSM734157", "GSM734170", "GSM734127", "GSM734143", "GSM734159", "GSM734158", "GSM734147", "GSM734171", "GSM734149", "GSM734141", "GSM734154", "GSM734169", "GSM734123"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE29621_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Jan 01 2014", "contributor": "Chen D, Yeatman T", "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434625049910}, "summary": "Compariosn of mRNA and miRNA profile in colon cancer", "meta": {"geo_id": 29621}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1306713600000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "McGill University", "Name": "Matthew Suderman", "City": "Montreal", "Zip/postal_code": "H3G 1Y6", "State/province": "Quebec", "Street address": "McIntyre Medical Building, 3655 Promenade Sir William Osler, Room 1309", "Country": "Canada"}, "accession": "GSE29721", "overall_design": "Cancerous and normal adjacent tissue samples were obtained from 11 patients with HCC from the Chinese National Human Genome Center at Shanghai, China (Dr. Ze-Guang Han).

The role of hypomethylation in altering gene expression in cancer cells has been poorly understood. Hepatic cellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human cancers. We use HCC as a model to investigate hypomethylation in cancer by a combination of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and hybridization with comprehensive promoter arrays. We identify approximately 2,800 promoters that are hypomethylated in tumor samples. The hypomethylated promoters appear in clusters across the genome suggesting a high-level organization behind the epigenomic changes in cancer. The genes whose promoters are demethylated are mainly involved in cell growth, cell adhesion and communication, signal transduction, mobility and invasion; functions that are essential for cancer progression and metastasis. Previous studies suggested that MBD2 was involved in demethylation of uPA and MMP2 genes in human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. We extend these results here showing that whereas MBD2 depletion in normal liver cells has little or no effect, its depletion in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and the adenocarcinoma cell line SkHep1 results in suppression of cell growth, anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness, as well as an increase in promoter methylation and silencing of several of the genes that are hypomethylated in tumors.

All the normal adrenal samples came from patients that underwent adrenalectomy along with a renalectomy due to renal carcinoma. The adrenal samples acquired from autopsies were obtained no more than six hours after death, and it was confirmed that the causes of death were unrelated to adrenal function. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to check the legitimacy of the normal control adrenal samples. Examination of tissue sections from each adrenal gland also suggested normal histology.  The APA samples were obtained from the Departments of Medicine at UT Southwestern and Division of Endocrinology at the University of Padua. All APA samples were from Conn\u2019s Syndrome patients with significantly elevated circulating aldosterone that was lowered to the normal range after surgical removal of the tumor. Thirty-two adenomas were collected from patients with primary hyperaldosteronism. Twenty-eight of these adenomas had levels of CYP11B2 that were two standard deviations (SD) greater than seen in normal adrenal glands and these samples were used for analyses. It is currently not clear if the adenomas with low CYP11B2 expression are the source of aldosterone in these patients. Other studies suggest that subcapsular micronodules have varying expression of steroidogenic enzymes-some with aldosterone synthase and some without (Shigematsu et al., 2006). Future studies are required to determine if some tumor-bearing adrenals from primary hyperaldosteronsim patients also have small CYP11B2 positive micronodules as the source of aldosterone production.  The cortisol-producing adenoma (CPA) tissues were obtained from Division of Endocrinology at the University of Padua from patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Each of the patients was cured following surgical removal of the adenoma. The use of these tissues was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX), the Medical College of Georgia (Augusta, GA), and University of Padua (Italy). In addition, this study was approved by the ethical committee at the University of Padua, and informed consent was obtained from every patient.  Microarray Analysis  Total RNA isolated from normal adult adrenal glands (n = 5) and APA (n = 10) were used on 15 genomic expression arrays. In brief, RNA was hybridized to an Affymetrix human HG-U133+2 oligonucleotide microarray set containing 54,675 probe sets representing approximately 40,500 independent human genes. The arrays were scanned at high resolution using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 located at Medical College of Georgia Microarray Core Facility (Augusta, GA). Results were analyzed using GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) to identify differences in expression of GPCR between normal adult adrenal and APA.  RNA Extraction   The tissue was pulverized in liquid nitrogen to a powder. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The purity and integrity of the RNA were assessed by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and its quantity was determined by NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).  cDNA Synthesis  2 \u00b5g of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following manufacturer recommendations and incubated at 25 \u00baC for 10 min, and 37 \u00baC for 2 h. The synthesized cDNA was subjected to 1:10 dilution and stored at -20\u00baC.  Real-Time Quantitative PCR  Primers and probes for the amplification of the selected GPCR sequences were performed using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) based on published sequences for genes encoding the respective human GPCR. The gene symbols and AB assay numbers are listed in Table 1.  The primer and probe set for human CYP11B2 was designed using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and purchased from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc, IA) as published previously (Saner-Amigh et al., 2006). In brief:  Forward: 5\u2019-GGCAGAGGCAGAGATGCTG-3\u2019,   Reverse: 5\u2019- CTTGAGTTAGTGTCTCCACCAGGA-3\u2019,   Probe:  5\u2019-CTGCACCACGTGCTGAAGCACT-3\u2019.  PCR reactions were performed using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a total volume of 20 \u03bcl per reaction following the reaction parameters recommended by the manufacturer, which includes denaturation at 95\u00baC for 20 s followed by amplification for 40 cycles (95\u00baC at 3 s, 60\u00baC at 30 s, fluorescence measurement). For each GPCR the 20 \u03bcl total volume consisted of 10 \u00b5l TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (2X) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 900 nM of each primer, 400 nM of the probe and 5 \u03bcl of each first-strand cDNA sample. CYP11B2 reaction mix consisted of 10\u00b5l TaqMan PCR Master Mix (2X) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 100 nM of primer/probe mix and 5 \u03bcl of each first-strand cDNA sample. 18s rRNA was detected and quantified using the TaqMan Ribosomal RNA Control Reagents (Vic Probe) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each reaction included 10 \u00b5l of TaqMan PCR Master Mix (2X) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 100 nM probe and 50 nM primers. Negative controls contained water instead of first-strand cDNA. Quantitative normalization of cDNA in each tissue-derived sample was performed using expression of 18s rRNA as an internal control. The generated Ct value of each gene was normalized by its respected Ct value of 18s rRNA (\u2206Ct). Then each gene was further normalized using the average \u2206Ct value of the normal adult adrenal (\u2206\u2206Ct).

RNA samples from normal adrenals (n = 5), APAs (n = 10), and cortisol-producing adenomas (CPAs) (n=13) were used on 15 genomic expression arrays, each of which included 223 GPCR transcripts presented in at least one out of 15 of the independent microarrays.

Four GPCR transcripts exhibited a statistically significant increase that was greater than 3-fold compared to normal adrenals, suggesting a general increase in expression compared to normal adrenal glands. Four GPCR transcripts exhibited a greater than 15-fold increase of expression in one or more of the APA samples compared to normal adrenals. qPCR analysis confirmed array data and found the receptors with the highest fold increase in APA expression to be luteinizing hormone receptor (LH-R), serotonin receptor 4 (HTR4), gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), glutamate receptor metabotropic 3 (GRM3), endothelin receptor type B-like protein (GPR37), and ACTH receptor (MC2R).

In this study, we aimed to determine whether molecular profiling of the liver identifies stages of disease at diagnosis. METHODS: We examined liver biopsies from 47 infants with biliary atresia enrolled in a prospective observational study. Biopsies were scored for inflammation and fibrosis, used for gene expression profiles, and tested for association with indicators of disease severity, response to surgery, and survival at 2 years. RESULTS: Fourteen of 47 livers displayed prominent features of inflammation (N=9) or fibrosis (N=5), with the remainder showing similar levels of both simultaneously. Differential profiling of gene expression of the 14 livers displayed a unique molecular signature containing 150 gene probes. Applying prediction analysis models, the probes classified 29 of the remaining 33 livers into inflammation or fibrosis. Molecular classification into the two groups was validated by the findings of increased hepatic population of lymphocyte subsets or tissue accumulation of matrix substrates. The groups had no association with traditional markers of liver injury or function, response to surgery, or complications of cirrhosis. However, infants with an inflammation signature were younger, while those with a fibrosis signature had decreased transplant-free survival. CONCLUSION: Molecular profiling at diagnosis of biliary atresia uncovers a signature of inflammation or fibrosis in most livers.

We used an in silico strategy based on gene expression signatures and connectivity analytics to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in 25 unique GC cell lines, and in 301 primary gastric cancers from three independent patient cohorts. Of 11 oncogenic pathways previously implicated in GC, we identified three predominant pathways (proliferation/stem cell, NF-kB, and Wnt/b-catenin) deregulated in the majority (>70%) of gastric tumors. Using a variety of proliferative, Wnt, and NF-kB-related assays, we experimentally validated the pathway predictions in multiple GC cell lines showing similar pathway activation patterns in vitro. Patients stratified at the level of individual pathways did not exhibit consistent differences in clinical outcome. However, patients grouped by oncogenic pathway combinations demonstrated robust and significant survival differences (e.g., high proliferation/high NF-kB vs. low proliferation/low NF-kB), suggesting that tumor behavior in GC is likely influenced by the combined effects of multiple oncogenic pathways.

We screened candidate genes suspected to be silenced by DNA methylation using oligonucleotide microarray analysis. To investigate the clinical significance of one candidate gene (UNC5B), we analyzed the correlation between mRNA expression and clinicopathological features using clinical tissue samples. Finally, methylation specific PCR analysis was performed to reveal whether the promoter region was methylated in CRC cell lines.  Results: We found 75 candidate genes that were potentially suppressed by DNA methylation in CRC. We focused on UNC5B, a possible tumor suppressor gene and regulator of apoptosis known to be inactivated in CRC. The mRNA expression analysis using tissue samples revealed that UNC5B mRNA was down-expressed in about 20% of CRC patients, and the patients with low-UNC5B-expression tumors showed a significantly higher recurrence rate after curative surgery. According to the univariate and multivariate analysis, low UNC5B expression was an independent risk factor for postoperative recurrence in stage I, II, and III CRC patients.

Normals consisted of healthy organs donated for transplantation. We measured gene expression on microarrays. Data were analyzed by hierarchical clustering and Principal Component Analysis. By this approach, we found that gene expression was similar in the upper and lower lobes of individuals with IPF. We also found that biopsied and explanted specimens contained different patterns of gene expression; therefore, we analyzed biopsies and explants separately. Signatures were derived by fitting top genes to a Bayesian probit regression model. We developed a 153-gene signature that discriminates IPF biopsies from normal. We also developed a 70-gene signature that discriminates IPF explants from normal. Both signatures were validated on an independent cohort. The IPF Biopsy signature correctly diagnosed 76% of the validation cases (p < 0.01), while IPF Explant correctly diagnosed 78% (p < 0.001).

Increasing evidence suggests that early treatment prevents the development of disability. However, there have been no reliable serum markers to assist the early diagnosis. In addition, interferon (IFN)-\u03b2, which is the major treatment for MS, is not always effective. Therefore, the development of simple serological test to help the early diagnosis and predict responsiveness to IFN-\u03b2 is of clinical importance. On the other hand, a transmembrane-type semaphorin, Sema4A, has been implicated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by regulating helper T (Th) cell differentiation. Thus, we aimed to identify the implications of Sema4A in diagnosis and pathogenesis of MS. Methods: We assayed serum Sema4A in 59 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 22 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and 126 patients with other neurological diseases (OND) by developing a sandwich ELISA. To identify a source of soluble Sema4A and characteristics of MS patients with high levels of Sema4A, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from MS patients and healthy controls by flow cytometry (FACS) and gene chip analysis. The effect of Sema4A was examined in vitro and in vivo using an EAE model. Findings: Sema4A was significantly increased in sera of patients with MS and CIS compared to controls. Sema4A expression was increased on the surface of DCs in MS patients and shed from these cells in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner, affecting the Th17skewing. In addition, patients with high Sema4A levels exhibited more severe disabilities, and IFN-\u03b2 treatment was not beneficial to those patients. Interpretation: Measuring Sema4A is a practical laboratory test to help diagnose MS and to predict responsiveness to IFN-\u03b2 therapy.", "meta": {"geo_id": 26484}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1294272000000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Phone": "+493094063798", "Organization name": "Charite-Berlin", "Country": "Germany", "City": "Berlin", "Zip/postal_code": "13125", "Fax": "+493094062846", "Name": "Qing Wang", "Street address": "Robert R\u00f6ssle Str. 10", "State/province": "Berlin"}, "accession": "GSE26886", "overall_design": "Gene expression profiling of 20 specimens of Barrett's esophagus patients, 21 specimens of adenocarcinoma patients and 19 biopsies from patients with normal esophageal squamous epithelium, 9 specimens of squamous cell carcinoma were studied.", "title": "Gene expression profiling of Barrett's esophagus, adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous epithelium and squamous cell carcinoma", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA135945"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a404a1385777d5121a9b"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM661734", "GSM661783", "GSM661735", "GSM661785", "GSM661758", "GSM661754", "GSM661743", "GSM661731", "GSM661741", "GSM661736", "GSM661744", "GSM661760", "GSM661749", "GSM661789", "GSM661737", "GSM661738", "GSM661727", "GSM661751", "GSM661784", "GSM661742", "GSM661747", "GSM661753", "GSM661787", "GSM661723", "GSM661730", "GSM661726", "GSM661759", "GSM661729", "GSM661752", "GSM661782", "GSM661722", "GSM661733", "GSM661761", "GSM661724", "GSM661728", "GSM661721", "GSM661781", "GSM661739", "GSM661746", "GSM661788", "GSM661745", "GSM661786", "GSM661725", "GSM661740", "GSM661755", "GSM661750", "GSM661748", "GSM661757", "GSM661756", "GSM661732"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE26886_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Oct 18 2013", "contributor": "Wang Q", "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434625026173}, "summary": "The aim of this study is to generate and validate biomarkers to stratify patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus in terms of risk for developing cancer.

Identification of the molecular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and elucidation of its crosstalk with tumor cells may therefore be crucial for improving our understanding of the processes implicated in cancer progression, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and uncovering stromal gene expression signatures that may predict clinical outcome. A key issue to resolve, therefore, is whether the stromal response to tumor growth is largely a generic phenomenon, irrespective of the tumor type, or whether the response reflects tumor-specific properties. To address similarity or distinction of stromal gene expression changes during cancer progression, oligonucleotide-based Affymetrix microarray technology was used to compare the transcriptomes of laser-microdissected stromal cells derived from invasive human breast and prostate carcinoma. Invasive breast and prostate cancer-associated stroma was observed to display distinct transcriptomes, with a limited number of shared genes. Interestingly, both breast and prostate tumor-specific dysregulated stromal genes were observed to cluster breast and prostate cancer patients, respectively, into two distinct groups with statistically different clinical outcomes. By contrast, a gene signature that was common to the reactive stroma of both tumor types did not have survival predictive value. Univariate Cox analysis identified genes whose expression level was most strongly associated with patient survival. Taken together, these observations suggest that the tumor microenvironment displays distinct features according to the tumor type that provides survival-predictive value.", "meta": {"geo_id": 26910}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1296086400000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Phone": "303-724-6054", "Organization name": "UC Denver", "Country": "USA", "State/province": "CO", "Zip/postal_code": "80045", "City": "Aurora", "Street address": "12700 East 19th Avenue, Box C272", "Name": "Michael Edwards"}, "accession": "GSE26966", "overall_design": "To elucidate mechanisms involved in pituitary tumorigenesis and progression, we performed individual gene expression microarray analysis using Affy U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips comparing 14 gonadotrope tumors with 9 normal pituitary samples obtained at autopsy.", "title": "Identification of Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible gene beta (GADD45beta) as a Novel Tumor Suppressor in Pituitary Gonadotrope Tumors", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA136983"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a404a1385777d5121ae3"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM663743", "GSM663758", "GSM663738", "GSM663748", "GSM663737", "GSM663746", "GSM663750", "GSM663753", "GSM663749", "GSM663752", "GSM663736", "GSM663739", "GSM663747", "GSM663741", "GSM663742", "GSM663754", "GSM663740", "GSM663751", "GSM663755", "GSM663744", "GSM663745", "GSM663757", "GSM663756"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE26966_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Jan 31 2011", "contributor": "Michaelis KA, Edwards MG, Wierman ME, Knox AJ, Xu M", "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434625026908}, "summary": "Gonadotrope or null cell pituitary tumors present clinically with signs of hypogonadism and hypopituitarism, together with visual disturbances due to mass effects.

To identify dysregulated genes and/or pathways that may play a role in tumorigenesis and/ or progression, molecular profiling was performed on 14 gonadotrope tumors and 9 normal human pituitaries from autopsy samples.  Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed clear discrimination between tumor and normal pituitary gene expression profiles. Bioinformatic analysis identified specific genes and pathways that were highly differentially regulated, including a cohort of putative downstream effectors of p53 were repressed in gonadotrope pituitary tumors, including GADD45\u03b2, GADD45\u03b3 and Reprimo with concomitant downregulation of the upstream regulator, PLAGL1.  PLAGL1 reexpression in gonadotrope cells did not directly modulate the downstream targets. Further functional analysis of GADD45\u03b2 was performed. Overexpression of GADD45\u03b2  in mouse gonadotrope cells blocked proliferation, increased rates of apoptosis in response to growth factor withdrawal and increased colony formation in soft agar. In contrast to prior studies with GADD45\u03b3, methylation interference assays showed no evidence of epigenetic modification of the GADD45\u03b2 promoter in pituitary tumors. Thus, our data suggest that many components downstream of p53 are suppressed in gonadotrope pituitary tumors. A novel candidate, GADD45\u03b2 is low in tumors and reexpression blocks proliferation, survival and tumorigenesis in gonadotrope cells. Unlike GADD45\u03b3, GADD45\u03b2 is not methylated to block its expression.

Narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) is considered an efficient treatment for moderate to severe AD. In psoriasis, NB-UVB has been found to suppress the Th1/Th17 immune polarization with subsequent reversal of epidermal hyperplasia. The immunomodulatory effects of this treatment are largely unknown in AD. Our study evaluates the effects of NB-UVB on immune and barrier abnormalities in AD, aiming to establish reversibility of disease and biomarkers of therapeutic response.  Methods: 12 moderate-to-severe chronic AD patients received NB-UVB phototherapy 3 times weekly for up to 12 weeks. Lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies were obtained before and after treatment and evaluated by gene-expression and immunohistochemistry studies.  Results: All patients had at least a 50% reduction in SCORing of AD (SCORAD) index with NB-UVB phototherapy. The Th2, T22, and Th1 immune pathways were suppressed and measures of epidermal hyperplasia and differentiation also normalized after phototherapy. The reversal of disease activity was associated with elimination of inflammatory leukocytes, Th2/\u201cT22\u201d-associated cytokines and chemokines, and normalized expression of barrier proteins.  Conclusions: Our study shows reversal of both the epidermal defects and underlying immune activation in AD.  By determining the correlation of variables with therapeutic response, we have defined a set of biomarkers of disease response that associate resolved Th2 and T22 inflammation with reversal of barrier pathology. This data supports the \u201cinside-out\u201d hypothesis of AD, suggesting that it is a disease primarily driven by an immune stimulus.", "meta": {"geo_id": 27887}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1299715200000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "IGBMC", "Lab": "LBGI", "Country": "France", "City": "Illkirch/Strasbourg", "Zip/postal_code": "67404", "Street address": "1 rue Laurent Fries", "Name": "Wolfgang Raffelsberger"}, "accession": "GSE28133", "overall_design": "In total 38 surgical specimens (samples) were analyzed, 19 represent biopsies from patients with retinal detachment (RD) and 19 represent contral samples without retinal detachment.", "title": "Transcriptomic analysis of human retinal detachment (RD) reveals both inflammation and photoreceptor death", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA139819"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a40ea1385777d5121ef6"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM697034", "GSM697039", "GSM697047", "GSM697018", "GSM697045", "GSM697016", "GSM697021", "GSM697041", "GSM697024", "GSM697040", "GSM697014", "GSM697049", "GSM697050", "GSM697030", "GSM697046", "GSM697015", "GSM697025", "GSM697017", "GSM697031", "GSM697043", "GSM697051", "GSM697019", "GSM697029", "GSM697044", "GSM697042", "GSM697020", "GSM697026", "GSM697033", "GSM697023", "GSM697038", "GSM697037", "GSM697036", "GSM697022", "GSM697048", "GSM697027", "GSM697028", "GSM697035", "GSM697032"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE28133_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Mar 06 2012", "contributor": "Delyfer M, Raffelsberger W, Mercier D, Korobelnik J, Gaudric A, Charteris DG, Tadayoni R, Metge F, Caputo G, Barale P, Ripp R, Muller J, Poch O, Sahel J, Leveillard T", "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434625037208}, "summary": "We have used surgical specimens to perform a differential analysis of the transcriptome of human retinal tissues following detachment.", "meta": {"geo_id": 28133}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1300838400000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "Uppsala University", "Name": "Anders Isaksson", "City": "Uppsala", "Zip/postal_code": "75185", "Street address": "Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr", "Country": "Sweden"}, "accession": "GSE28571", "overall_design": "Short-term (<20 months; n=53) and long-term survivors (>58 months; n=47) were selected from a clinically well-characterized NSCLC patient cohort with available fresh-frozen tumor specimens.

Patients with severe AH have a poor short-term prognosis. Unfortunately, current therapies (i.e. corticosteroids and pentoxyphylline) are not effective in many patients and novel targeted therapies are urgently needed. The development of such therapies is hampered by a poor knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Based on studies from animal models, TNF alfa was proposed to play a pivotal role in the mechanisms of AH.   Consequently, drugs interfering TNF alfa were tested in these patients. The results were disappointing due to an increased incidence of severe infections. Unluckily, there are not experimental models that mimic the main findings of AH in humans.

Using Affymetrix microarray data from these breast tumors, we established the expression profiling of breast cancer based on HER2 IHC and FISH results. To validate microarray experiment data, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed. Results: We found significant differences between the HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast tumor samples, which included overexpression of HER2, as well as other genes located on 17q12, and genes functionally related to migration.

The relative position of genes on chromosomes has therefore important functional implications and can be exploited to model microarray datasets.  Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumours in adults and their prognosis is related to histology and grade.  In  oligodendrogliomas, allelic loss of 1p/19q and hypermethylation of MGMT promoter is associated with longer survival and chemosensitivity.  In this work we used oligonucleotide microarray to study a group of 30 gliomas with various oligodendroglial and astrocytic components.  We used an original approach combining a wavelet model of inter-probe genomic distance (CHROMOWAVE) and unsupervised method of analysis (Singular Value Decomposition) in order to discover new prognostic chromosomal patterns of gene expression.  We identified a major pattern of variation that strongly correlated with survival (p= 0.007) and could be visualized as a genome-wide chromosomal pattern including widespread gene expression changes on 1p, 19q, 4, 18, 13 and 9q and multiple smaller clusters scattered along chromosomes.  Gene expression changes on chromosomes 1p, 19q and 9q were significantly correlated with the allelic loss of these regions as measured by FISH.  Differential expression of genes implicated in drug resistance was also a feature of this chromosomal pattern and in particular low expression of MGMT was correlated with favourable prognosis (p<0.0001).  Remarkably, unsupervised analysis of the expression of individual genes and not of their chromosomal ensemble produced a pattern that could not be associated with prognosis, emphasizing the determinant role of the wavelet mathematical modelling.

Demographic and exposure differences between HPV-positive (+) and negative (-) HNSCCs suggest that HPV(+) tumors may constitute a subclass with different biology, while clinical differences have also been observed. In this study, gene expression profiles of HPV(+) and (-) tumors were compared to further explore the biological effect of HPV in HNSCC. Methods: Thirty-six HNSCC tumors were analyzed for gene expression using Affymetrix Human 133U Plus 2.0 GeneChip and for HPV using consensus primers for HPV L1, E6 and E7 by PCR and RT-PCR. Results: Eight (22%) of 36 tumors were positive for HPV, all of the HPV 16 subtype, and the HPV positive samples also expressed viral HPV E6 mRNA determined by RT-PCR. Patients with HPV(+) HNSCCs were on average younger than those with HPV(-) tumors (mean age 50.2 vs. 58.7). Statistical analysis using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) based on HPV status as a supervising parameter resulted in a list of 91 genes that were differentially expressed with statistical significance. Results for a sub-set of these genes were verified by RT-PCR. Genes highly expressed in HPV(+) samples included cell cycle regulators (p16INK4A, p18 and CDK2) and transcription factors (TAF7L, RFC4, RPA2 and TFDP2). The microarray data were also investigated using DIGMap to map genes by chromosomal location. A large number of genes on chromosome 3q24-qter was found to be overrepresented in HPV(+) tumors. Conclusion: The gene expression profile associated with HPV reflects alterations in cell cycle and proliferation signals. Further investigation of differentially expressed genes may reveal the unique pathways in HPV(+) tumors that may explain the different natural history and biological properties of these tumors. These properties may be exploited as a target of novel therapeutic agents in HNSCC treatment.", "meta": {"geo_id": 3292}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1126483200000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "OSU", "Lab": "Davuluri Lab", "Country": "USA", "City": "Columbus", "Zip/postal_code": "43210", "Name": "Sandya Liyanarachchi", "Street address": "Rm 594, 420, W 12th Avenue", "State/province": "OH"}, "accession": "GSE3467", "overall_design": "Total RNA was extracted from paired tumor and normal thyroid tissues from 9 PTC patients.

To characterize biological processes involved in PTC invasion, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of microscopically dissected intratumoral samples from central and invasive regions of seven widely invasive PTCs and normal thyroid tissue by oligonucleotide microarray and performed confirmatory expression and functional studies. In comparison to the central regions of primary PTCs, the invasive fronts overexpressed TGFbeta, NFkappaB and integrin pathway members, and regulators of small G-proteins and CDC42. Moreover, reduced levels of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion and communication were identified, consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To confirm that aggressive PTCs were characterized by EMT, 35 additional PTCs were examined for expression of vimentin, a hallmark of EMT.  Overexpression of vimentin was associated with PTC invasion and nodal metastasis. Functional, in vitro studies demonstrated that vimentin was required for the development and maintenance of both a mesenchymal morphology and invasiveness in thyroid cancer cells.

Although these precancerous lesions have been subjected to extensive clinical, pathological, and molecular analyses, little is currently known about the global gene expression changes accompanying their formation. Results: To characterize the molecular processes underlying the transformation of normal colonic epithelium, we compared the transcriptomes of 32 prospectively collected adenomas with those of normal mucosa from the same individuals. Important differences emerged not only between the expression profiles of normal and adenomatous tissues, but also between those of small and large adenomas. A key feature of the transformation process was the remodeling of the Wnt pathway reflected in patent over- and underexpression of 78 known components of this signaling cascade.

The aim of the study was to analyze the gene expression profiling of synchronous and metachronous lesions in order to identify molecular signatures as possible basis for choice of systemic therapies. Fresh tissues specimens from metastases of 18 patients undergone liver surgery were collected (10 synchronous and 8 metachronous lesions). Gene expression profiling was studied using Affymetrix platform. Two different profiles were identified. Pathway related to the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGFr) was upregulated in metachronous lesions whereas pathways mainly related to inflammation in synchronous lesions. Real Time-PCR, Western Blotting and ELISA confirmed that the metachronous lesions had the overexpression of EGFr, but the synchronous ones had the overexpression of Cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2).

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples are easy to handle, stable and particularly suitable for morphologic evaluation, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. However, it has become a paradigm that these samples cannot be used for genome-wide expression analysis with microarrays. To oppose this view, we present a pilot microarray study using FFPE core needle biopsies from breast cancers as RNA source.  We found that microarray probes interrogating sequences near the poly-A-tail of the transcribed genes were well suitable to measure RNA levels in FFPE core needle biopsies. For the ER and the HER2 gene, we observed strong correlations between RNA levels measured in these probe sets and protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry (p = 0.000003 and p = 0.0022). Further, we have identified a signature of 364 genes that correlated with ER protein status and a signature of 528 genes that correlated with HER2 protein status. Many of these genes (ER: 60%) could be confirmed by analysis of an independent publicly available data set. Finally, a hierarchical clustering of the biopsies with respect to three recently reported gene expression grade signatures resulted in widely stable low and high expression grade clusters that correlated with the pathological tumor grade.  These findings support the notion that clinically relevant information can be gained from microarray based gene expression profiling of FFPE cancer biopsies. This opens new opportunities for the integration of gene expression analysis into the workflow of invasive cancer diagnostics as well as translational research in the setting of clinical studies.", "meta": {"geo_id": 11001}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1206921600000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam", "Lab": "Forensic Molecular Biology", "Country": "Netherlands", "City": "Rotterdam", "Zip/postal_code": "3015 GE", "Name": "Dmitry Zubakov", "Street address": "Dr. Molewaterplein, 50", "State/province": "ZH"}, "accession": "GSE11151", "overall_design": "We analysed several arrays per specific type of renal tumor and normal kidney tissues", "title": "Gene expression data from different types of renal tumors and normal kidneys", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA106953"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a37aa1385777d511e229"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM281337", "GSM281327", "GSM281302", "GSM281291", "GSM281319", "GSM281328", "GSM281326", "GSM281300", "GSM281295", "GSM281340", "GSM281297", "GSM281282", "GSM281281", "GSM281321", "GSM281305", "GSM281320", "GSM281293", "GSM281341", "GSM281290", "GSM281284", "GSM281298", "GSM281323", "GSM281317", "GSM281310", "GSM281287", "GSM281331", "GSM281338", "GSM281335", "GSM281301", "GSM281307", "GSM281279", "GSM281336", "GSM281289", "GSM281334", "GSM281318", "GSM281278", "GSM281343", "GSM281285", "GSM281324", "GSM281332", "GSM281283", "GSM281342", "GSM281344", "GSM281306", "GSM281339", "GSM281286", "GSM281280", "GSM281288", "GSM281292", "GSM281329", "GSM281296", "GSM281308", "GSM281333", "GSM281294", "GSM281322", "GSM281304", "GSM281313", "GSM281303", "GSM281299", "GSM281330", "GSM281325", "GSM281309"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE11151_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Sep 25 2008", "contributor": "Szponar A, Zubakov D, Pawlak J, Jauch A, Kovacs G", "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434624889226}, "summary": "Identification and evaluation of specific molecular markers is of great importance for reliable diagnostics and outcome prediction of renal neoplasms", "meta": {"geo_id": 11151}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1207872000000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Country": "Hungary", "Phone": "36309347069", "Organization name": "AOTK", "Name": "Norbert Solymosi", "City": "Budapest", "Zip/postal_code": "1078", "Street address": "Istv\u00e1n u. 2.", "State/province": "Budapest"}, "accession": "GSE11499", "overall_design": "Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of patients with Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and hybridized on Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays", "title": "Expression data from Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) human peripheral blood samples", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA106317"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a380a1385777d511e365"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM289250", "GSM289246", "GSM289253", "GSM289249", "GSM289247", "GSM289252", "GSM289254", "GSM289248", "GSM289245", "GSM289251", "GSM289244"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE11499_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on May 19 2009", "contributor": "Galamb O, Molnar B, Spisak S, Sipos F", "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434624892390}, "summary": "The whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis of peripheral blood samples can contribute to the determination of distant blood markers of local pathophysiological alterations in colorectal diseases.

METHODS: Macrophages were derived from the peripheral blood of 8 AS patients (median disease duration 13 years [range <1-43 years]) and 9 healthy control subjects over 7 days with the use of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Cells were stimulated for 24 hours with interferon-gamma (IFNgamma; 100 units/ml), were left untreated for 24 hours, or were treated for 3 hours with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 ng/ml). RNA was isolated and examined by microarray and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Microarray analysis revealed 198 probe sets detecting the differential expression of 141 unique genes in untreated macrophages from AS patients compared with healthy controls. Clustering and principal components analysis clearly distinguished AS patients and controls. Of the differentially expressed genes, 78 (55%) were IFN-regulated, and their relative expression indicated a reverse IFN signature in AS patient macrophages, where IFNgamma-up-regulated genes were underexpressed and down-regulated genes were overexpressed. Treatment of macrophages with exogenous IFNgamma normalized the expression of these genes between patients and controls. In addition, the messenger RNA encoded by the IFNgamma gene was approximately 2-fold lower in AS patient macrophages at baseline (P = 0.004) and was poorly responsive to LPS (P = 0.018), as compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal consistent differences in gene expression in macrophages from AS patients, with evidence of a striking reverse IFN signature. Together with poor expression and responsiveness of the IFNgamma gene, these results suggest that there may be a relative defect in IFNgamma gene regulation, with autocrine consequences and implications for disease pathogenesis.", "meta": {"geo_id": 11886}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1214352000000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "Harvard Medical School", "Lab": "Ocular Molecular Genetics Institute", "Country": "USA", "City": "Boston", "Zip/postal_code": "MA 02114", "State/province": "MA", "Street address": "243 Charles Street", "Name": "Dyonne T.

Despite being the primary cause of hysterectomy in the United States, accounting for up to 200,000 procedures annually, the etiology of leiomyoma remains largely unknown.  Due to the lack of an effective medicinal therapy for these tumors, this disease continues to have a tremendous negative impact on women\u2019s health. As a basis for understanding leiomyoma pathogenesis and identifying targets for pharmacotherapy, we conducted transcriptional profiling of leiomyoma and unaffected myometrium from humans and Eker rats, the best characterized preclinical model of leiomyoma. A global comparison of mRNA from leiomyoma versus myometrium in human and rat identified a highly significant overlap of dysregulated gene expression in leiomyoma.  An unbiased pathway analysis using a method of gene set enrichment based on the Sigpathway algorithm detected the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as one of the most highly upregulated pathways in both human and rat tumors. Activation of this pathway was confirmed in both human and rat leiomyomata at the protein level via Western.  Inhibition of mTOR in female Eker rats with the rapamycin analog WAY-129327 for 2 weeks decreased mTOR signaling and cell proliferation in tumors, and treatment for 4 months significantly decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity and size. These results identify dysregulated mTOR signaling as a component of leiomyoma etiology across species and directly demonstrate the dependence of these tumors on mTOR signaling for growth in the Eker rat. Modulation of this pathway warrants additional investigation as a potential therapy for uterine leiomyoma.", "meta": {"geo_id": 13319}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1224720000000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Country": "USA", "Organization name": "University of Michigan", "Name": "Goncalo Abecasis", "City": "Ann Arbor", "Zip/postal_code": "48105", "Street address": "1420 Washington Heights", "State/province": "MI"}, "accession": "GSE13355", "overall_design": "We extracted total RNA from punch biopsies taken from 58 psoriatic patients and 64 normal healthy controls.

Consistent downregulation of TOB1, a critical regulator of cell proliferation, was characteristic of group #1 patients. Decreased TOB1 expression at the RNA and protein levels was also confirmed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

All patients with clinically diagnosed early or locally advanced pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis and matched healthy control were recruited from the UCLA Medical Center. The controls were matched for gender, age, ethnicity and smoking history. We chose early and locally advanced pancreatic cancers because they were considered early stage diseases. All patients were recently diagnosed with primary disease, and had not received any prior treatment in the form of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or alternative remedies. No subjects had a history of prior malignancy, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorders, hepatitis, or HIV infection. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients who agreed to serve as saliva donors. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected and processed as previously described. The saliva bank of pancreatic disease at the UCLA Dental Research Institute has collected 283 saliva samples since 2006. Of these, 114 samples, from 42 pancreatic cancer patients, 30 chronic pancreatitis patients and 42 healthy control subjects, met the following eligibility criteria: the disease subjects\u2019 samples were obtained immediately after primary diagnosis from patients without evidence of metastasis; the saliva sample was free of blood (Table 1 in accompanying manuscript). Of the 114 samples, 12 pancreatic cancer samples and 12 healthy control samples were chosen for the discovery and verification phase.

Lack of early detection technology for pancreatic cancer invariably leads to a typical clinical presentation of incurable disease at initial diagnosis. Oral fluid (saliva) meets the demand for non-invasive, accessible, and highly efficient diagnostic medium. The level of salivary analytes, such as mRNA and microflora, vary upon disease onset; thus possess valuable signatures for early detection and screening. In this study, we evaluated the performance and translational utilities of the salivary transcriptomic and microbial biomarkers for non-invasive detection of early pancreatic cancer. Two biomarker discovery technologies were used to profile transcriptome in saliva supernatant and microflora in saliva pellet. The Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array was used to discover altered gene expression in saliva supernatant. The Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) was used to investigate microflora shift in saliva pellet. Biomarkers selected from both studies were subjected to an independent clinical validation using a cohort of 30 early pancreatic cancer, 30 chronic pancreatitis and 30 healthy matched-control saliva samples. Two panels of salivary biomarkers, including eleven mRNA biomarkers and two microbial biomarkers were discovered and validated for pancreatic cancer detection. The logistic regression model with the combination of three mRNA biomarkers (ACRV1, DMXL2 and DPM1) yielded a ROC-plot AUC value of 0.974 (95% CI, 0.896 to 0.997; P < 0.0001) with 93.3% sensitivity and 90% specificity in distinguishing pancreatic cancer patients from healthy subjects. The logistic regression model with the combination of two bacterial biomarkers (Neisseria elongata and Streptococcus mitis) yielded a ROC-plot AUC value of 0.895 (95% CI, 0.784 to 0.961; P < 0.0001) with 96.4% sensitivity and 82.1% specificity in distinguishing pancreatic cancer patients from healthy subjects. Importantly, the logistic regression model with the combination of four biomarkers (mRNA biomarkers, ACRV1, DMXL2 and DPM1; bacterial biomarker, S. mitis) could differentiate pancreatic cancer patients from all non-cancer subjects (chronic pancreatitis and healthy control), yielding a ROC-plot AUC value of 0.949 (95% CI, 0.877 to 0.985; P < 0.0001) with 92.9% sensitivity and 85.5% specificity. This study comprehensively compared the salivary transcriptome and microflora between pancreatic cancer and control subjects. We have discovered and validated eleven mRNA biomarkers and two microbial biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer in saliva. The logistic regression model with four salivary biomarkers can detect pancreatic cancer specifically without the complication of chronic pancreatitis. This is the first report demonstrating the value of multiplex salivary biomarkers for the non-invasive detection of a high impact systemic cancer.", "meta": {"geo_id": 14245}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1230595200000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Country": "USA", "Phone": "3013985014", "Organization name": "MedImmune, LLC", "State/province": "MD", "City": "Gaithersburg", "Zip/postal_code": "20878", "Street address": "One MedImmune Way", "Name": "Brandon W Higgs"}, "accession": "GSE14905", "overall_design": "A total of 82 Affymetrix HGU133 Plus arrays were run on 54 total subjects.

Highly purified CD4+ and CD8+ (purity >95%) cell subsets were then sorted by flow cytometry on MoFlo high speed cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and frozen in Trizol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol\u00ae (Invitrogen),  according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality and purity were assessed with the use of the RNA 6000 Nano assay on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Total RNA from each sample was prepared using GeneChip\u00ae one Cycle cDNA Synthesis kit and GeneChip\u00ae IVT Labeling kit (Affymetrix), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Briefly, starting from 2.5\u00b5g total RNA, biotinylated cRNA was produced by one cycle of reverse transcription and in vitro transcription (IVT). Biotinylated cRNA was fragmented and hybridized for 16 h at 45\u00b0C onto GeneChip\u00ae Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix). The statistical analysis was performed couple by couple using the Rosetta Resolver\u00ae system (Rosetta Biosoftware). The fold-change of each gene was calculated by comparing gene expression in the affected twin with that in the unaffected twin and the genes with the same trend in at least 3 twin pairs out of the 4 studied were selected as candidates to be validated by real-time RT-PCR.", "title": "Gene expression profile in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from identical twins discordant for Multiple sclerosis", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA116037"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a3a7a1385777d511f45f"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM413797", "GSM413805", "GSM413792", "GSM413794", "GSM413795", "GSM413791", "GSM413793", "GSM413799", "GSM413790", "GSM413796", "GSM413802", "GSM413801", "GSM413800", "GSM413798", "GSM413803", "GSM413804"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE16461_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Dec 31 2010", "contributor": "Annibali V, Ristori G, F.

However, there is currently no translation of these classifiers for application in routine diagnostic. Therefore, we aimed at validating own and published gene expression signatures employing methods which enable RNA and protein detection in routine diagnostic specimens.    Results  Immunohistochemistry was applied to 68 stage UICC II colon cancers to determine the protein expression of five selected previously published classifier genes (CDH17, LAT, CA2, EMR3, and TNFRSF11A). Correlation of protein expression data with clinical outcome within a 5-year post-surgery course failed to separate patients with a disease-free follow-up [Group DF] and relapse [Group R]). In addition, RNA from macrodissected tumor samples from 53 of these 68 patients was profiled on Affymetrix GeneChips (HG-U133 Plus 2.0). Prognostic signatures were generated by Nearest Shrunken Centroids with cross-validation. Although gene expression profiling allowed the identification of differentially expressed genes between the groups DF and R, a stable classification and prognosis signature was not discernable in our data. Furthermore, the application of previously published gene signatures consisting of 22 and 19 genes, respectively, to our gene expression data set using \u2018global tests\u2019 and leave-one-out cross-validation was unable to predict clinical outcome (prediction rate 75.5% and 64.2%; n.s.). T-stage was the only independent prognostic factor for relapse in multivariate analysis with established clinical and pathological parameters including microsatellite status.  Conclusions  Our protein and gene expression analyses currently do not support application of molecular classifiers for prediction of clinical outcome in routine diagnostic as a basis for patient-orientated therapy in stage UICC II colon cancer.

As a result, we identified MUC12 as a candidate gene involved in metastasis processes by microarray analysis. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR showed that MUC12 expression was significantly lower in cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001). In stage II and stage III CRC, patients with low expression showed worse disease-free survival (P = 0.038).

Neuroblastomas belong to the group of neuroblastic tumors, together with the more benign, differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas. Little is known of the genes driving the differentiation processes in these tumor types. A search for the transcription factors differentially expressed between ganglioneuromas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and neuroblastomas in a series of 110 neuroblastic tumors (NB110) identified a large number of HOX- and TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension)-class homeobox transcription factor genes. The MEIS1-3, PBX1 and -3, and PKNOX1 TALE genes showed highest expression in neuroblastomas and lowest in ganglioneuromas and ganglioneuroblastomas. The PKNOX2 and TGIF1-2 genes showed the opposite expression pattern. This suggests an involvement of TALE genes in neuroblastoma differentiation. Expression of MEIS1, a known oncogene in haematopoietic tumors, was high in all neuroblastomas, and strongly correlated with undifferentiated histology. Consequently, we generated IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells capable of inducible shRNA-mediated MEIS1 knockdown. We observed differentiation, growth arrest and induction of apoptosis upon MEIS1 down-regulation. Affymetrix profiling of time-course experiments using these cells allowed the identification of MEIS1 target genes. Analysis of the target genes in the NB110 series showed that 323 of these were also significantly correlated to MEIS1 expression and to tumor differentiation in neuroblastic tumors. Genes involved in the cell cycle and in developmental pathways were over-represented in this gene set. We conclude that MEIS1 governs several of the signal transduction routes important for neuroblastoma survival and differentiation.", "meta": {"geo_id": 18271}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1253750400000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Country": "Taiwan", "Phone": "886-7-7317123", "Organization name": "Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Kaohsiung", "Fax": "886-7-7336856", "City": "Kaohsiung Hsien", "Zip/postal_code": "83342", "Street address": "123, Ta-Pei Rd., Niao-Sung Hsiang", "Name": "Kuang-Den Chen"}, "accession": "GSE18309", "overall_design": "The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) transcriptomes from 5 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 4 AD, as well as 4 normal controls (NC), were analyzed by microarray analysis.", "title": "Transcriptomes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Dementia and Alzheimer Patients", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA118041"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a3baa1385777d511faee"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM457169", "GSM457177", "GSM457171", "GSM457175", "GSM457170", "GSM457172", "GSM457173", "GSM457174", "GSM457176"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL, CHP)", "name": "GSE18309_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Nov 30 2009", "contributor": "Chen K, Wang P, Chang P, Ping Y, Yeh C, Lee H", "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434624951320}, "summary": "With the aging population, there is a growing focus on dementia, especially Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD).

Patients and Methods: We conducted a high-resolution analysis of genomic imbalances in 78 de novo pediatric HGG, including 7 diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, and 10 HGG cases arising in children who received cranial irradiation for a previous cancer, using Affymetrix 500K GeneChips.  Gene expression signatures for 53 tumors were analyzed with Affymetrix U133v2 arrays.  Results were compared with publicly available data from adult tumors. Results:  Pediatric and adult glioblastoma were clearly distinguished by frequent gain of chromosome 1q (30% vs 9%) and lower frequency of chromosome 7 gain (13% vs 74%), respectively.  The most common focal amplifications also differed, with PDGFRA and EGFR predominant in childhood and adult populations respectively. These common alterations in pediatric HGG were detected at higher frequency in irradiation-induced tumors, suggesting that these are initiating events in childhood gliomagenesis. CDKN2A was the most common tumor suppressor gene targeted by homozygous deletion in pediatric HGG. No IDH1 hotspot mutations were found in pediatric tumors, highlighting molecular differences in pathogenesis between childhood HGG and adult secondary glioblastoma. Integrated copy number and gene expression data indicated that deregulated PDGFRA signaling plays a major role in pediatric HGG. Conclusions:  Integrated molecular profiling showed substantial differences in the molecular features underlying pediatric and adult HGG, indicating that findings in adult tumors cannot be simply extrapolated to younger patients.

The sample collection followed the PRoBE principle (prospective specimen collection). The saliva bank for breast cancer project at the UCLA Dental Research Institute in collaboration with Cedars Sinai Medical Center has collected 200 saliva samples since 2007 with all subjects recruited from the Saul and Joyce Brandman Breast Cancer Center. Of these, 113 samples, including 41 breast cancer patients and 72 healthy control individuals, were selected for the discovery and validation phase of this study. Inclusion criteria of cancer patients consisted of a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer. Exclusion criteria of cancer patients included therapy/surgery and/or a diagnosis of other malignancies within 5 years prior to saliva collection. Exclusion criteria of control patients included a diagnosis of any malignancies within 5 years prior to saliva collection. Written informed consents and questionnaire data sheets were obtained from all patients who agreed to serve as saliva donors. Unstimulated saliva samples were consistently collected, stabilized, and preserved as previously described. The sample supernatants were reserved at -80 C prior to assay. This study consisted of a discovery phase, followed by an independent preclinical validation phase. Of the 113 samples, 10 breast cancer samples and 10 healthy control samples were chosen for the discovery phase. All breast cancer cases are invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), the most common type of breast cancer. Biomarkers identified from the discovery studies were first verified using the discovery sample set.

The Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 Array and 2D-DIGE were used to profile transcriptomes and proteomes in saliva supernatants respectively. Significant variations of salivary transcriptomic and proteomic profiles were observed between breast cancer patients and healthy controls. Eleven transcriptomic biomarker candidates and two proteomic biomarker candidates were selected for a preclinical validation using an independent sample set. Transcriptomic biomarkers were validated by RT-qPCR and proteomic biomarkers were validated by quantitative protein immunoblot. Eight mRNA biomarkers and one protein biomarker have been validated for breast cancer detection, yielding ROC-plot AUC values between 0.665 and 0.959.

Most colorectal cancers (CRC) arise in a progression through adenoma to carcinoma phenotypes as a consequence of altered genetic information. Clinical progression of CRC may occur in parallel with distinctive signaling alterations. We designed multidirectional analyses integrating microarray-based data with biostatistics and bioinformatics to elucidate the signaling and metabolic alterations underlying CRC development in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.    Methodology/Principal Findings. Studies were performed on normal mucosa, adenoma, and CRC samples obtained during surgery or colonoscopy. Collections of cryostat sections prepared from the tissue samples were evaluated by a pathologist to control the relative cell type content. RNA was isolated from 105 macro- and 40 microdissected specimens. The measurements were done using Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133plus2, and probe set data were generated using two normalization algorithms: MAS5 and GCRMA with LVS. The data were evaluated using pair-wise comparisons and data decomposition into SVD modes. The method selected for the functional analysis used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Based on a consensus of the results obtained by two tissue handling procedures, two normalization algorithms, and two probe set sorting criteria, we identified six KEGG signaling and metabolic pathways (cell cycle, DNA replication, p53 signaling pathway, purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and RNA polymerase) that are significantly altered in both macro- and microdissected tumor samples compared to normal colon. On the other hand, pathways altered between benign and malignant tumors were identified only in the macrodissected tissues.  Conclusion/Significance. Multidirectional analyses of microarray data allow the identification of essential signaling alterations underlying CRC development. Although the proposed strategy is computationally complex and labor\u2013intensive, it may reduce the number of false results.", "meta": {"geo_id": 20916}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1268697600000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Phone": "0086-379-63185307", "Organization name": "No.150 Military Central Hospital", "Country": "China", "City": "Luoyang", "Zip/postal_code": "471009", "Name": "Zhiqiang Yao", "Street address": "No.288, Zhongzhou Road", "State/province": "Henan"}, "accession": "GSE21354", "overall_design": "Total RNA was isolated from 14 tumor tissue of patients, which included 5 astrocytomas WHO grade II (T2), 5 oligodendro-gliomas WHO grade II (T2) and 4 ependymomas WHO grade II (T2) samples, in additional to 4 normal tissues.

We developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on this 368-gene list in a learning set, and tested its predictive performances in an independent validation set. Then, we assessed its prognostic value and that of six prognostic signatures for disease-free survival (DFS) in the remaining 2034 samples. The SVM model accurately classified all MBC samples in the learning and validation sets. A total of 466 cases were basal across other sets. The SVM classifier separated them into two subgroups, subgroup 1 (resembling MBC) and subgroup 2 (not resembling MBC). Subgroup 1 exhibited 71% 5-year DFS, whereas subgroup 2 exhibited 50% (p=9.93E-05). The classifier outperformed the classical prognostic variables in multivariate analysis, conferring lesser risk for relapse in subgroup 1 (HR=0.52, p=3.9E-04).

We sought to decipher complex genomic data sets by matching the genetic alterations contained within these, with candidate cells of origin, to generate accurate disease models.  Using an integrated genomic analysis we first identified subgroups of human ependymoma: a form of neural tumor that arises throughout the central nervous system (CNS).  Validated alterations included amplifications and homozygous deletions of genes not yet implicated in ependymoma.  Matching the transcriptomes of human ependymoma subgroups to those of distinct types of mouse radial glia (RG)\u2014neural stem cells (NSCs) that we identified previously to be a candidate cell of origin of ependymoma - allowed us to select RG types most likely to represent cells of origin of disease subgroups.  The transcriptome of human cerebral ependymomas that amplify EPHB2 and delete INK4A/ARF matched most closely that of embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf-/- RG:  remarkably, activation of EphB2 signaling in this RG type, but not others, generated highly penetrant ependymomas that modeled accurately the histology and transcriptome of one human cerebral tumor subgroup (subgroup \u2018D\u2019).  Further comparative genomic analysis revealed selective alterations in the copy number and expression of genes that regulate neural differentiation, particularly synaptogenesis, in both mouse and human subgroup \u2018D\u2019 ependymomas; pinpointing this pathway as a previously unknown target of ependymoma tumorigenesis.

First, to identify a molecular signature associated with nodal metastasis, gene expression analysis was performed on a homogeneous group of 96 primary breast tumors, balanced for lymph node involvement. Each tumor was diagnosed as a poorly differentiated, estrogen positive, her2-neu negative invasive ductal cancer. (Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 microarray chips). A model, including 241 genes was built and validated on an internal and external dataset performed with Affymetrix technology. All samples used for validation had the same characteristics as the initial tumors. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the internal dataset was 0.646 and 0.651 for the external datasets. Thus, the molecular profile of a breast tumor reveals information about lymph node involvement, even in a homogeneous group of tumors. However, an AUC of 0.65 indicates only a weak correlation. Our model includes multiple kinases, apoptosis related and zinc ion binding genes. Pathway analysis using the Molecular Signatures Database revealed relevant gene sets (BAF57, Van 't Veer). Next, miRNA profiling was performed on 82/96 tumors using Human MiRNA microarray chips (Illumina). Eight miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed according to lymph node status at a significance level of 0.05, without correcting for multiple testing. The analysis of the inverse correlation between a miRNA and its computationally predicted targets point to general deregulation of the miRNA machinery potentially responsible for lymph node invasion. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that lymph node involvement in breast cancer is not a random process.", "meta": {"geo_id": 23177}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1280188800000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Phone": "+81-76-265-2234", "Organization name": "Kanazawa University", "Country": "Japan", "City": "Kanazawa", "Zip/postal_code": "920-8641", "Street address": "13-1 Takaramachi", "Name": "Hirofumi Misu"}, "accession": "GSE23343", "overall_design": "Samples for analysis were obtained from ten patients with type 2 diabetes and 7 subjects with normal glucose tolerance, who were admitted to Kanazawa University Hospital.

This system has recently been shown to outperform other FFPE methods/ kits regarding yield of amplifiable RNA (Okello et al., 2010). Quality assessment of extracted material was performed with the Paradise Reagent Quality Assessment Kit (Molecular Devices), as well as via NanoDrop (Thermoscientific). All samples yielded sufficient genetic material (>50 ng) for subsequent reactions. 50 ng of extracted purified nucleic acid underwent RNA amplification using WT-Ovation FFPE System (NuGen) followed by FL-Ovation cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGen) for labeling and microarray (Affymetrix HGU133 v2) hybridization. All 30 microarrays (one per specimen) performed within acceptable limits (Scaling factor: 32.6 +/- 3.7; RawQ: 1.28 +/- 0.01; GapDH 3\u2019:5\u2019: 1.48 +/- 0.08; % present 35.4 +/- 1.5) and were not significantly different across treatment (p < 0.5 for all measures, 1-ANOVA). In general, these results indicate a smaller signal in laser captured FFPE samples than in prior fresh frozen samples (Scaling factor: 5.9 +/- 0.6; RawQ 2.7 +/- 0.04; GapDH 3\u2019:5\u2019: 3.65 +/- 0.55; % present: 44.6 +/- 1.1) with an increased scaling factor decreased RawQ and reduced % present all indicating reduced signal volume, while the smaller GapDH ratio suggests more degraded material- consistent with other reports of the dynamics of small FFPE sample results. Further, the % present call, while lower than found in fresh frozen tissue, is much greater than would be expected by chance (5%).This suggests that the extracted genetic material still contains a large amount of valid data. Probe sets were annotated, and transcriptional profiles were generated, using the MAS5 algorithm and annotation data sets (Affymetrix Expression Console v. 1.1; HGU133 annotation October, 2003) in order to facilitate comparison with prior work.

Although much research has examined molecular pathways associated with AD, relatively few studies have focused on critical early stages. Our prior microarray study correlated gene expression in human hippocampus with AD markers. Results suggested a new model of early-stage AD in which pathology spreads along myelinated axons, orchestrated by upregulated transcription and epigenetic factors related to growth and tumor suppression (Blalock et al., 2004). However, the microarray analyses were performed on RNA from fresh frozen hippocampal tissue blocks containing both gray and white matter, potentially obscuring region-specific changes. In the present study, we used laser capture microdissection to exclude major white matter tracts and selectively collect CA1 hippocampal gray matter from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) hippoc ampal sections of the same subjects assessed in our prior study. Microarray analyses of this gray matter-enriched tissue revealed many correlations similar to those seen in our prior study, particularly for neuron-related genes. Nonetheless, in the laser-captured tissue, we found a striking paucity of the AD-associated epigenetic and transcription factor genes that had been strongly overrepresented in the prior tissue block study. In addition, we identified novel pathway alterations that may have considerable mechanistic implications, including downregulation of genes stabilizing ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release and upregulation of vascular development genes. We conclude that FFPE tissue can be a reliable resource for microarray studies, that upregulation of growth-related epigenetic/ transcription factors with incipient AD is predominantly localized to white matter, further supporting our prior findings and model, and that alterations in vascular and ryanodine receptor-relat ed pathways in gray matter are closely associated with incipient AD.", "meta": {"geo_id": 28146}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1300924800000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Country": "Spain", "Phone": "+34953220306", "Organization name": "Hospital Medico-Quirurgico de Jaen", "Name": "Laura Vera", "City": "Jaen", "Zip/postal_code": "23007", "Street address": "Avenida del Ejercito Espa\u00f1ol 10", "State/province": "Jaen"}, "accession": "GSE28844", "overall_design": "Refer to individual Series", "title": "Differentially expressed genes after treatment with chemotherapy in breast cancer and their correlation with pathologic response", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA140625"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a417a1385777d512218a"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM710799", "GSM710980", "GSM710510", "GSM710937", "GSM710940", "GSM710745", "GSM706703", "GSM710800", "GSM710527", "GSM706710", "GSM706699", "GSM710508", "GSM710511", "GSM710512", "GSM710939", "GSM706711", "GSM706689", "GSM710798", "GSM710978", "GSM710744", "GSM710509", "GSM710497", "GSM710791", "GSM706202", "GSM710528", "GSM710790", "GSM706687", "GSM706705", "GSM710938", "GSM706712", "GSM710936", "GSM706692"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE28844_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Dec 12 2012", "contributor": null, "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434625043216}, "summary": "This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.", "meta": {"geo_id": 28844}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1303689600000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "The Johns Hopkins University", "Lab": "Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery", "Name": "Joseph Califano", "State/province": "MD", "Zip/postal_code": "21231", "City": "Baltimore", "Street address": "1550 Orleans Street", "Country": "USA"}, "accession": "GSE29330", "overall_design": "We performed pharmacological unmasking analysis on two HNSCC cancer cell lines JHU-O11 and JHU-O12 by treating cells with or without 5-aza-dC, followed by RNA extraction and microarray analysis using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0.

We performed a four-phase strategy to obtain the unmasked genes in the cells treated with 5-aza and downregulated genes in primary tumors.

In the third phase, we investigated these three data sets: a) SAM output of 1960 upregulated genes after 5-aza treatment of JHU-012 vs SAM output of 7140 downregulated genes in primary HNSCC: We found that 210 genes that were upregulated by 5-aza-dC in the JHU-O12 cell line and showed downregulation in tumor samples, b) SAM output of 614 upregulated genes after 5-aza treatment of JHU-011 vs SAM output of 7140 downregulated genes in primary HNSCC: We found 79 genes that were upregulated by 5-aza-dC in the JHU-O11 cell line and showed downregulation in tumor samples, c) SAM output from analyzing both cell lines together in the same SAM computation, of 427 upregulated genes after 5-aza treatment of JHU-011 and JHU-012 vs SAM output of 7140 downregulated genes in primary HNSCC: We found 44 genes that were upregulated by 5-aza-dC in JHU-O11 and JHU-012 cell lines and showed downregulation in tumor samples, suggesting that methylation might be involved in gene downregulation.    In the fourth phase of our strategy, we rank-ordered the results of upregulated genes obtained from these 3 data sets and found 126 common genes. We then examined promoter regions of the 126 genes for CpG islands and performed bisulfite sequencing analysis of the promoter region of these genes.

Integrative analysis defined 126 candidate genes, of which only seven genes showed differentially methylation in tumors and no methylation in normal mucosa after bisulfite sequencing. After validation by QMSP, one gene, GNG7, was confirmed as being highly methylated in tumors and unmethylated in normal mucosal and salivary rinse samples demonstrating cancer-specific methylation in HNSCC tissues.

consequence of epigenetic alterations associated with cancer is the ectopic expression of tissue-restricted genes. Here, a new strategy was developed to decipher genome-wide expression data in search for these \u201coff-context\u201d gene activations, which consisted first, in identifying a large number of tissue-specific genes normally epigenetically silenced in most somatic cells and second, in using them as cancer biomarkers on an \u201con/off\u201d basis. Applying this concept to analyze whole-genome transcriptome data in lung cancer, we discovered a specific group of 26 genes whose expression was a strong and independent predictor of poor prognosis in our cohort of 293 lung tumours, as well as in two independent external populations. In addition, these 26 classifying genes enabled us to isolate a homogenous group of metastatic-prone highly aggressive tumours, whose characteristic gene expression profile revealed a high proliferative potential combined to a significant decrease in immune and signaling functions. This work illustrates a new approach for a personalized management of cancer, with applications to any cancer type.

We employed oligonucleotide microarray to find changes in global gene expression of five CRC cell lines. These were analyzed before and after treatment with the 5-aza-2'-Deoxycitidine. Expression of the responding genes was integrated with gene expression profiling generated by microarray analysis of matched colorectal tissue samples. Selected candidates were subjected to methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using CRC cell lines and paired tumor and normal samples from CRC patients. Sixty eight genes were re-expressed after 5-aza-2'-Deoxycitidine treatment and over-expressed in normal colorectal mucosa, including genes that were known to be methylated in CRC. After applying study selection criteria, we identified 16 potential genes. Two candidates were selected (ASPP1 and SCARA5). Among 15 CRC cell lines, methylation was identified in SCARA5 (20%). The methylation status of SCARA5 was subsequently investigated in 23 paired colorectal tissue samples; methylation was detected in 17%, respectively. Observed promoter methylation showed a tendency towards methylation in tumor-derived samples, in SCARA5 gene. Significant down expression of SCARA5 mRNA was observed in CRC cell lines and tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The use of genome-wide screening led to the identification of a group of candidate genes. Among them, SCARA5 was methylated and markedly down-regulated in CRC.

Four of four patients are progression free at a median time of 27.5 months (22-103 months).  To characterize the molecular biology of cGBM, we compared the gene expression profiles of 3 cGBMs to 12 pediatric and 6 primary adult glioblastomas collected at our institution. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed cGBMs grouped together with other high-grade gliomas. cGBMs demonstrated marked similarity to both pediatric and adult GBMs, with only a total of 31 differentially expressed genes identified (FDR < 0.05). Unique molecular features of congenital GBMs identified included over-expression of multiple genes involved in glucose metabolism and tissue hypoxia pathways. Four tyrosine kinases were also mong the up-regulated genes (RET, RASGRF2, EFNA5, ALK). Thus, at our institution congenital GBMs, while similar both histologically and molecularly to other GBMs, appear to have a good prognosis with surgery in combination with relatively moderate chemotherapy.

The relationship of GSTP1 expression and GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation with intrinsic subtypes was also investigated. In this study, primary breast cancer patients (n = 123, stage II-III) treated with neoadjuvant P-FEC were analyzed. Tumor samples were obtained by vacuum-assisted core biopsy before P-FEC. GSTP1 expression was determined using immunohistochemistry, GSTP1 promoter methylation index (MI) using bisulfite methylation assay and intrinsic subtypes using DNA microarray. The pathological complete response (pCR) rate was significantly higher in GSTP1-negative tumors (80.0%) than GSTP1-positive tumors (30.6%) (P = 0.009) among estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors but not among ER-positive tumors (P = 0.267). Multivariate analysis showed that GSTP1 was the only predictive factor for pCR (P = 0.013) among ER-negative tumors. Luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors showed a significantly lower GSTP1 positivity than basal-like tumors (P = 0.002, P < 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively), while luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors showed a higher GSTP1 MI than basal-like tumors (P = 0.076, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, these results suggest the possibility that GSTP1 expression can predict pathological response to P-FEC in ER-negative tumors but not in ER-positive tumors.

Despite recent data showing a genetic predisposition to epidermal barrier defects in some patients, a fundamental debate still exists regarding the role of barrier abnormalities versus immune responses in initiating the disease. An extensive study of nonlesional AD (ANL) skin is necessary to explore whether there is an intrinsic predisposition to barrier abnormalities, background immune activation, or both in patients with AD. We sought to characterize ANL skin by determining whether epidermal differentiation and immune abnormalities that characterize lesional AD (AL) skin are also reflected in ANL skin.  We performed genomic and histologic profiling of both ANL and AL skin lesions (n = 12 each) compared with normal human skin (n = 10). We found that ANL skin is clearly distinct from normal skin with respect to terminal differentiation and some immune abnormalities and that it has a cutaneous expansion of T cells. We also showed that ANL skin has a variable immune phenotype, which is largely determined by disease extent and severity. Whereas broad terminal differentiation abnormalities were largely similar between involved and uninvolved AD skin, perhaps accounting for the background skin phenotype, increased expression of immune-related genes was among the most obvious differences between AL and ANL skin, potentially reflecting the clinical disease phenotype. Our study implies that systemic immune activation might play a role in alteration of the normal epidermal phenotype, as suggested by the high correlation in expression of immune genes in ANL skin with the disease severity index.", "meta": {"geo_id": 32924}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1318377600000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "Chang Guang University", "Name": "Yi Huang", "City": "Kwei-Shan Tao-Yuan", "Zip/postal_code": "333", "Street address": "259 Wen-Hwa 1st Road", "Country": "Taiwan"}, "accession": "GSE33006", "overall_design": "3-paired HCC tissue samples and adjacent normal liver tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery and were frozen immediately after surgical resection.", "title": "Gene expression profiles from the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA148029"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a438a1385777d51230b9"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM818280", "GSM818279", "GSM818281", "GSM818278", "GSM818277", "GSM818276"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE33006_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Aug 31 2012", "contributor": "Huang Y, Chen S", "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434625079486}, "summary": "To explore the molecular functions targeted by these miRNAs, we classified genes differentially expressed in clinical HCC samples into six functional clusters based on their functional similarity.", "meta": {"geo_id": 33006}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1318636800000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam", "Country": "Netherlands", "City": "Amsterdam", "Zip/postal_code": "1100DE", "Street address": "P.O.

However, it is not known to what extent changes in the copy number of individual genes are associated with the observed expression changes. To address this, a genome wide analysis of chromosome copy number and gene expression was performed in tumour cells micro-dissected from the same NPC biopsies. Significant gene expression changes were identified in tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) and in tumour-promoting genes (TPGs) but almost 60% of these can be either upregulated or downregulated in different types of cancer. This suggests that the simplistic classification of genes as TSGs or TPGs may not be entirely appropriate and that the concept of onco-suppressors may be more extensive than previously recognised. Several genomic regions showing frequent copy number gain or loss were identified. Whereas TSGs were significantly enriched within regions of frequent loss, no significant enrichment of TPGs was observed in regions of frequent gain. However, on a gene by gene basis little correlation was found between DNA copy number and alterations in gene expression except for loss of expression from homozygous deletions and a single highly amplified segment which showed enhanced gene expression.

The primary pathogenesis of the disease is still elusive, resulting in lack of specific treatments. The prevailing view is that AD is a biphasic, T-cell polarized disease, with Th2 predominating acute AD, and a switch to Th1 characterizing chronic disease. Identification of factors that participate in onset of  lesions and maintenance of chronic lesions is critical for development of targeted therapeutics. We performed global genomic, molecular and cellular profiling of paired non-lesional, acute, and chronic skin biopsies from ten AD patients. Onset of acute lesions is associated with a striking increase in a subset of terminal differentiation proteins, specifically the IL-22-modulated S100A7-9. Correspondingly, acute disease is associated with significant increases in gene expression levels of the major Th22- (IL-22) and Th2- (IL-4, IL-31) cytokines and Th17-regulated genes (CCL20, PI3/Elafin), without significant changes in IL-17. A lesser induction of Th1- (IFN\u03b3, MX-1, CXCL9-11) associated genes was detected in acute disease. Chronic skin lesions are characterized by significantly intensified activation of Th22, Th2 and Th1. Our data establish increased expression of S100A7-9 and other epidermal genes at onset of acute AD, with parallel activation of Th2 and Th22 cytokines. Our findings suggest an absence of switch mechanism in chronic disease and instead indicate that progression to chronic lesions is associated with intensified activation of immune axes that initiate onset of acute lesions, particularly Th22 and Th2.

The most prevalent genetic alteration in ccRCC is the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene VHL. Using whole-genome and exome sequencing we discovered BAP1 as a novel tumor suppressor in ccRCC that shows little overlap with mutations in PBRM1, another recent tumor suppressor. Whereas VHL was mutated in 81% of the patients (142/176), PBRM1 was lost in 58% and BAP1 in 15% of the patients analyzed. All these tumor suppressor genes are located in chromosome 3p, which is partially or completely lost in most ccRCC patients. However, BAP1 but not PBRM1 loss was associated with higher Fuhrman grade and, therefore, poorer outcome. Xenograft tumors (tumorgrafts) implanted orthotopically in mice exhibited similar gene expression profiling to corresponding primary tumors. Gene expression profiling of tumors and tumorgrafts displayed different signatures for BAP1- and PBRM1-deficient samples. Thus, after inactivation of VHL, the acquisition of a mutation in BAP1 or PBRM1 defines a different program that might alter the fate of the patient.

In order to understand the mechanism/signaling pathways responsible for invasion, migration and metastasis in colorectal cancer, we developed an integrative and comparative genetic approach to infer transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying colon cancer progression.   Accordingly, we filtered fourteen human colorectal cancer (CRC) microarray data sets, from an immune competent mouse model of metastasis to identify known and novel transcriptional regulators in CRC. Using this approach, Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors were identified as metastasis driver of colon cancer.  NFAT family of transcription factors  is known to induce gene transcription in various disease processes, including carcinogenesis.

However, mechanisms underlying pathogenesis in MCPyV-negative MCC remain poorly understood. To nominate genes contributing to pathogenesis of MCPyV-negative MCC, we performed DNA microarray analysis on 30 MCCs. MCPyV status of MCCs was determined by PCR for viral DNA and RNA. 1593 probe-sets were differentially expressed between MCPyV-negative and -positive MCC, with significant differential expression defined as at least 2-fold change in either direction and p-value of \u2264 0.05. MCPyV-negative tumors showed decreased RB1 expression, whereas MCPyV-positive tumors were enriched for immune response genes. Validation studies included immunohistochemistry demonstration of decreased RB protein expression in MCPyV-negative tumors and increased peritumoral CD8+ T lymphocytes surrounding MCPyV-positive tumors. In conclusion, our data suggest that loss of RB1 expression may play an important role in tumorigenesis of MCPyV-negative MCC.

The mitotic checkpoint is an important mechanism that prevents aneuploidy through restraining the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). USP44 was identified as a key regulator of APC activation that maintains the association of MAD2 with the APC co-activator Cdc20. However, the physiological importance of USP44 and its impact on cancer biology are unknown. Here, we show that USP44 is required to prevent tumors in mice and is frequently down-regulated in human lung cancer. USP44 inhibits chromosome segregation errors independently of its role in the mitotic checkpoint by regulating proper centrosome separation, positioning, and mitotic spindle geometry, functions that require direct binding to the centriole protein, centrin. These data reveal a new role for the ubiquitin system in mitotic spindle regulation and underscore the importance of USP44 in the pathogenesis of human cancer.", "meta": {"geo_id": 40791}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1347321600000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "University of Kentucky and Markey Cancer Center", "Name": "Suleiman Massarweh", "City": "Lexington", "Zip/postal_code": "40536", "State/province": "KY", "Street address": "800 Rose St., Cc452", "Country": "USA"}, "accession": "GSE40837", "overall_design": "This was a single-institution, phase II study of adding sorafenib to existing endocrine therapy.

We conducted a phase-II study of adding the VEGFR/Ras/Raf/MAPK inhibitor sorafenib to endocrine therapy in metastatic ER-positive breast cancer, either upon progression or after maximal response with measurable residual disease. Tumor biopsies and serum were collected on days 1 and 28. Primary endpoint was response by RECIST after 3 months and secondary endpoints included safety, time to progression (TTP), and biomarker assessment. Planned sample size was 43 patients but the study closed after 11 patients because of slow accrual. 8 patients had progressive disease (PD) on entry and 3 had stable disease (SD). One patient with SD discontinued sorafenib after 2-weeks because of grade 3 rash. Of the 10 remaining patients after adding sorafenib, 7 had SD (70%), 3 had PD (30%) and median TTP was 6.1-months. Of the 8 patients who entered the study with PD on endocrine therapy, 5 converted to SD (62%) with a median TTP of 6.4-months. Notably, patients on tamoxifen had a median TTP of 8.4-months. The most common adverse events were hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and rash, and the majority were grade 1&2 with no grade 4 toxicities. There was a significant reduction in serum VEGFR2 and PDGFR-\u03b1 on day-28 (p-values 0.0035 and 0.017, respectively). Both serum VEGF and sVEGFR-1 were increased on day-28, but the differences were not statistically significant (p-values 0.3223 and 0.084, respectively).

Additionally, liver- and peritoneal metastases were analysed and compared to primary cancer tissue. The integrin and ephrin receptor families were upregulated in all PDAC samples, irrespective of outcome, supporting an important role of the interaction between pancreatic cancer cells and the surrounding desmoplastic reaction in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Moreover, some components, such as ITGB1 and EPHA2, were upregulated in PDAC samples with a poor outcome, Additionally, overexpression of the non-canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and EMT genes in PDAC samples with bad versus good outcome suggests their contribution to the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer, with \u03b2-catenin being also highly upregulated in metastatic tissue.

To obtain target genes of PRC2 in SCLC, H3K27me3 mark was mapped in three SCLC cell lines, Lu130, H209 and DMS53, and compared to normal small airway epithelial cells (SAEC). Whereas H3K27me3(+) genes in SAEC were significantly overlapped with PRC-target genes in ES cells (P=1.7x10-31), genes with H3K27me3 in SCLC cell lines but not in SAEC were not significantly overlapped with PRC-target genes in ES cells (P=0.64). These genes with H3K27me3 specifically in SCLC cell lines but not in SAEC showed decreased expression, not only in SCLC cell lines but also in clinical SCLCs, and showed enrichment of GO-terms such as plasma membrane (P=8.1x10-21) and cell adhesion (P=1.7x10-8). Introduction of JUB, a gene showing specific H3K27me3 modification and the strongest repression in the three SCLC cell lines, resulted in repression of cellular growth in DMS53. In clinical SCLC cases, lower JUB level correlated to shorter survival (P=0.002), or a set of PRC target genes (JUB, EPHB4) and marker genes of classic type SCLC (GRP, ASCL1) correlated to shorter survival (P=0.0001) and classified SCLC into two groups with distinct prognosis. Growth of SCLC cell lines was repressed when treated with 3-Deazaneplanocin A, an inhibitor against PRC2.

However, the utility of this approach to identify outcome-related genes and dysregulated pathways following first-time myocardial infarction (AMI) remains unknown and may offer a novel strategy to detect affected expressome networks that predict long-term outcome.  Whole-genome microarray and targeted cytokine expression profiling on blood samples from normal cardiac function controls and first-time AMI patients within 48-hours post-MI revealed expected differential gene expression profiles enriched for inflammation and immune-response pathways in AMI patients. To determine molecular signatures at the time of AMI that could prognosticate long-term outcomes, transcriptional profiles from sub-groups of AMI patients with (n=5) or without (n=22) any recurrent events over an 18-month follow-up were compared. This analysis identified 559 differentially expressed genes. Bioinformatic analysis of this differential gene set for associated pathways revealed 1) increasing disease severity in AMI patients is associated with a decreased expression of the developmental epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and 2) modulation of cholesterol transport genes that include ABCA1, CETP, APOA1, and LDLR is associated with clinical outcome. In conclusion, differentially regulated genes and modulated pathways were identified that predicted recurrent cardiovascular outcomes in first-time AMI patients. This cell-based approach for risk stratification in AMI warrants a larger study to determine the role of metabolic remodeling and regenerative processes required for optimal outcomes. A validated transcriptome assay could represent a novel, non-invasive platform to anticipate modifiable pathways and therapeutic targets to optimize long-term outcome for AMI patients.", "meta": {"geo_id": 48060}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1371513600000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Phone": "949 824 6071", "Organization name": "UC Irvine", "Lab": "Carl W.

IFX is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, but how IFX affect KD vasculitis is unknown. We investigated expression profiling of whole blood cells to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the effectiveness of IFX therapy and to find characteristic biomarker and an important target in refractory KD. Methods: Refractory KD patients who failed to respond to repeated intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) infusions had received a single infusion of IFX as third therapy. To validate specifically transcripts abundance for IFX therapy, we detected the altered transcripts expression and signaling pathways of whole blood mRNA in these IFX-responsive patients (n=8) using Affymetrix array, comparing initial IVIG-responsive patients (n=6).Results: A total of 1,388 transcripts abundance were significantly altered before and after IFX treatment. These transcripts abundance in IFX had Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain pathway that play a role in activation of NF\u03baB and IL-1 signaling pathway outside the field of TNF-\u03b1 signaling pathway. Fifty transcripts including Peptidase inhibitor-3 (PI3), Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP8), Chemokine (C-C motif) receptor-2 (CCR2) and Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) were significantly down-regulated in IFX. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 by IFX have affected various molecular mechanism materially for IVIG-resistant KD patients.", "meta": {"geo_id": 48498}, "type":

Surgical samples obtained during mastectomy were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C. Only samples from patients without neoadjuvant chemotherapy were used in this study as chemotherapy may seriously affect gene expression profile. All tissue samples were collected at the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin. Seventeen tumor samples were collected from patients with hereditary breast cancer: 12 were derived from tumors affecting women with hereditary BRCA1 mutation, the only one from a woman with BRCA2 mutation, while another eight cases had familial history of breast/ovarian cancer, but were negative for the BRCA1/2 mutations (so called BRCAx cases). Proportion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated tumors was typical for the Polish population. Ten samples were derived from patients with apparently sporadic disease (no familial history of cancer) while 4 patients had a history of familial cancer aggregation (FCA) but without prevalence of breast/ovarian cancers. Thus, these samples were merged with sporadic samples in most of the analyses.  All BRCA1 mutation-linked tumors in our study were negative for estrogen receptor (by immunohistochemistry, standard procedures for ER, PGR and HER2 staining were applied), while the only BRCA2-mutated tumor was ER-positive. There were 26 ductal and 5 medullary carcinomas within the study group, which is consistent with the distribution of histopathological types in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Patients were diagnosed at stage T1-2, N0-1 and M0. Caution: this submission contains the data from 6 microarrays done on the normal/pathologically unchanged breast tissue from breast cancer patiets.

Our results show that a previously reported marked difference between BRCA1-mutation linked and sporadic breast cancer was probably due to uneven stratification of samples with different ER status and basal-like versus luminal-like subtype. We observed that apparent difference between BRCA1-linked and other types of breast cancer found in univariate analysis was diminished when data were corrected for ER status and molecular subtype in multivariate analyses. In fact, the difference in gene expression pattern of BRCA1-mutated and sporadic cancer is very discrete. These conclusions were supported by the results of Q-PCR validation. We also found that BRCA1 gene inactivation due to promoter hypermethylation had similar effect on general gene expression profile as mutation-induced protein truncation. This suggests that in the molecular studies of hereditary breast cancer, BRCA1 gene methylation should be recognized and considered together with gene mutation.", "meta": {"geo_id": 50567}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1378252800000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "Roche", "Lab": "TTB Biostatistics", "Name": "Anton Belousov", "City": "Penzberg", "Zip/postal_code": "82377", "Street address": "Nonnenwald 2", "Country": "Germany"}, "accession": "GSE50948", "overall_design": "Gene expression profiling was performed using RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded core biopsies from 114 pre-treated patients with HER2-positive (HER2+) tumors randomized to receive neoadjuvant doxorubicin/paclitaxel (AT) followed by cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF), or the same regimen in combination with trastuzumab for 1 year.

It is diagnosed and staged at surgery, resulting in an 11-year latency from symptom onset to diagnosis, underscoring the need for less invasive, less expensive approaches. Since the uterine lining (endometrium) in women with endometriosis has altered molecular profiles, we tested whether molecular classification of this tissue can distinguish and stage disease. We developed classifiers using genomic data from n=148 archived endometrial samples from women with endometriosis or without endometriosis (normal controls or with other common uterine/pelvic pathologies) across the menstrual cycle and evaluated their performance on independent sample sets.  Classifiers were trained separately on samples in specific hormonal milieu, using margin tree classification, and accuracies were scored on independent validation samples. Classification of samples from women with endometriosis or no endometriosis involved two binary decisions each based on expression of specific genes. These first distinguished presence or absence of uterine/pelvic pathology and then no endometriosis from endometriosis, with the latter further classified according to severity (minimal/mild or moderate/severe). Best performing classifiers identified endometriosis with 90-100% accuracy, were cycle phase-specific or independent, and utilized relatively few genes to determine disease and severity. Differential gene expression and pathway analyses revealed immune activation, altered steroid and thyroid hormone signaling/metabolism and growth factor signaling in endometrium of women with endometriosis. Similar findings were observed with other disorders versus controls. Thus, classifier analysis of genomic data from endometrium can detect and stage pelvic endometriosis with high accuracy, dependent or independent of hormonal milieu. We propose that limited classifier candidate-genes are of high value in developing diagnostics and identifying therapeutic targets. Discovery of endometrial molecular differences in the presence of endometriosis and other uterine/pelvic pathologies raises the broader biological question of their impact on the steroid hormone response and normal functions of this tissue.", "meta": {"geo_id": 51981}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1383264000000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "Duke University", "Lab": "201 Med Sci Res Bldg.", "Name": "Mark Dewhirst", "State/province": "NC", "Zip/postal_code": "27710", "City": "Durham", "Street address": "Research Dr.", "Country": "USA"}, "accession": "GSE52322", "overall_design": "37 breast tissue samples were collected under ultrasound guidance from patients with stage IIB/III breast cancer before four cycles of neoadjuvant liposomal doxorubicinpaclitaxel chemotherapy combined with local whole breast hyperthermia.

This study performed in two separate patient populations focused on the activation of adaptive and innate immunity in early inflamed acne. Biopsies were collected from lesional and non-lesional skin of acne patients. Psoriasis patients and healthy volunteers were included in the study for comparison (not included in the records). Using Affymetrix Genechips, we observed significant elevation of the signature cytokines of the Th17 lineage in acne lesions compared to non-lesional skin. The increased expression of IL-17 was confirmed with real-time qPCR (RT-PCR) in two separate patient populations. Cytokines involved in Th17 lineage differentiation (IL-1beta, IL-6, TGF-beta; IL23p19) were remarkably induced at the RNA level. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-\u03b1), Th1 markers (IL12p40, CXCR3, T-bet, IFN-gamma), T regulatory cell markers (Foxp3, IL-10, TGF-\u03b2) and antimicrobial peptides (S100A7, S100A9, LNC2, hBD2, hBD3, hCAP18) were induced. Importantly, immunohistochemistry revealed significantly increased numbers of IL-17A positive T cells and CD83 dendritic cells in the acne lesions. In summary our results demonstrate the presence of IL17A positive T cells and the activation of Th17-related cytokines in acne lesions, indicating that the Th17 pathway may play a pivotal role in the disease process, offering new targets of therapy.", "meta": {"geo_id": 53795}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1388707200000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "National University of Singapore", "Country": "Singapore", "City": "Singapore", "Zip/postal_code": "117599", "Street address": "14 Medical Drive, #11-01, Singapore", "Name": "Tuan Zea Tan"}, "accession": "GSE54002", "overall_design": "Mammary gland cells were captured from clinical tissues of breast cancer patient by LCM.

We used genomic and molecular techniques to investigate host-virus interactions by mapping the entire liver of patients with HCC. We compared the gene signature of whole liver tissue (WLT) versus laser capture-microdissected (LCM) hepatocytes with intrahepatic expression of HBV. Gene expression profiling was performed on up to 17 WLT specimens obtained at various distances from the tumor center in individual livers of 11 patients with HCC and on selected LCM samples. HBV biomarkers were determined by real-time PCR and confocal immunofluorescence. Analysis of 5 areas of the liver showed a sharp change in gene expression between the immediate perilesional area and tumor periphery that correlated with a significant decrease in the intrahepatic expression of HBsAg. The tumor was characterized by a large preponderance of down-regulated genes, mostly involved in the metabolism of lipid and fatty acid, glucose, amino acids and drugs, with down-regulation of pathways involved in the activation of PXR/RXR and PPARa/RXRa nuclear receptors, comprising PGC1 and FOXO1, two key regulators of the hepatic metabolic functions and HBV transcription. These findings were confirmed by gene expression of microdissected hepatocytes. However, LCM of malignant hepatocytes also revealed up-regulation of unique genes associated with cancer and signaling pathways, including two novel HCC-associated cancer testis antigen (CTA) genes, NUF2 and TTK. HCC-associated with HBV is characterized by a metabolism switch-off and by a significant reduction in HBsAg. LCM proved to be a critical tool to validate gene signatures associated with HCC and to identify genes that may play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis opening new perspectives for the discovery of novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.", "meta": {"geo_id": 55092}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1392681600000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "Rockefeller University", "Country": "USA", "State/province": "NY", "Zip/postal_code": "10075", "City": "New York", "Street address": "1230 York ave", "Name": "Mayte Suarez-Farinas"}, "accession": "GSE55201", "overall_design": "total RNA was extratced from whole blood from psoriasis patients at baseline and after two weeks of treatment; total RNA was extracted from the whole blood of healthy individuals", "title": "Suppression of inflammation in psoriasis blood after IL-17 treatment with ixekizumab", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA238896"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a4f8a1385777d5127dad"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM1331477", "GSM1331462", "GSM1331467", "GSM1331494", "GSM1331461", "GSM1331485", "GSM1331464", "GSM1331463", "GSM1331468", "GSM1331475", "GSM1331514", "GSM1331516", "GSM1331524", "GSM1331454", "GSM1331473", "GSM1331490", "GSM1331480", "GSM1331520", "GSM1331526", "GSM1331458", "GSM1331470", "GSM1331459", "GSM1331491", "GSM1331497", "GSM1331512", "GSM1331513", "GSM1331517", "GSM1331523", "GSM1331501", "GSM1331499", "GSM1331525", "GSM1331465", "GSM1331530", "GSM1331527", "GSM1331534", "GSM1331509", "GSM1331515", "GSM1331493", "GSM1331484", "GSM1331460", "GSM1331481", "GSM1331522", "GSM1331496", "GSM1331505", "GSM1331521", "GSM1331531", "GSM1331528", "GSM1331486", "GSM1331508", "GSM1331506", "GSM1331511", "GSM1331457", "GSM1331504", "GSM1331471", "GSM1331483", "GSM1331487", "GSM1331466", "GSM1331495", "GSM1331500", "GSM1331455", "GSM1331469", "GSM1331474", "GSM1331472", "GSM1331478", "GSM1331510", "GSM1331533", "GSM1331488", "GSM1331492", "GSM1331476", "GSM1331519", "GSM1331479", "GSM1331502", "GSM1331507", "GSM1331532", "GSM1331482", "GSM1331529", "GSM1331503", "GSM1331456", "GSM1331489", "GSM1331498", "GSM1331518"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE55201_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Mar 31 2014", "contributor": "Su\u00e1rez-Fari\u00f1as M, Wang CQ, Krueger JG, Hoffman RW", "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434625268456}, "summary": "The effect of anti-IL-17 treatment on systemic inflammation is not fully understand.

This study examines the effects of soy supplementation on breast cancer-related genes and pathways.  Methods   Women (n = 140) with early-stage breast cancer were randomized to soy protein supplementation (n = 70) or  placebo (n = 70) for 7 to 30 days, from diagnosis until surgery. Adherence was determined by plasma isoflavones:  genistein and daidzein. Gene expression changes were evaluated by NanoString inin pre- and post-treatment  tumor tissue. Genome-wide expression analysis was performed on post-treatment tissue. Proliferation (Ki67) and  apoptosis (Cas3) were assessed by immunohistochemistry.  Results   Plasma isoflavones rose in the soy group (two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < .001) and did not change in  the placebo group. In paired analysis of pre- and post-treatment samples, 21 genes (out of 202) showed altered  expression (two-sided Student\u2019s t-test, P < .05). Several genes including FANCC and UGT2A1 revealed different  magnitude and direction of expression changes between the two groups (two-sided Student\u2019s t-test, P < .05).  A high-genistein signature consisting of 126 differentially expressed genes was identified from microarray analysis  of tumors. This signature was characterized by overexpression (>2 fold) of cell cycle transcripts, including  those which promote cell proliferation, such as FGFR2, E2F5, BUB1, CCNB2, MYBL2, CDK1, and CDC20 (P < .01).  Soy intake did not result in statistically significant changes in Ki67 or Cas3.  Conclusions   Gene expression associated with soy intake and high plasma genistein define a signature characterized by overexpression  of FGFR2 and genes that drive cell cycle and proliferation pathways. These findings raise the concerns  that in a subset of women soy could adversely affect gene expression in breast cancer.", "meta": {"geo_id": 58792}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1403568000000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1426809600000}}, {"pubmed_id": null, "data_source": "geo", "contact": {"Organization name": "Rockefeller University", "Country": "USA", "State/province": "NY", "Zip/postal_code": "10075", "City": "New York", "Street address": "1230 York ave", "Name": "Mayte Suarez-Farinas"}, "accession": "GSE59294", "overall_design": "18 Patients with AD treated with dupilumab or placebo . 28 biopsies in LS Skin (16 pre-treatment and 12 post-treatment). 12 biopsies in NL Skin (7 pre-treatment and 5 post treatment)", "title": "Blocking IL-4R\u03b1 with dupilumab (REGN668/SAR231893) rapidly suppresses major pathomechanisms in the skin of severe atopic dermatitis patients", "relations": {"BioProject": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA254978"]}, "organism": "Homo sapiens", "_id": {"$oid": "5582a513a1385777d5128900"}, "platforms": ["GPL570"], "web_link": null, "samples": ["GSM1432970", "GSM1432952", "GSM1432943", "GSM372294", "GSM1432947", "GSM1432974", "GSM372306", "GSM372302", "GSM1432968", "GSM372303", "GSM1432972", "GSM372290", "GSM372287", "GSM1432958", "GSM1432957", "GSM1432967", "GSM372298", "GSM372300", "GSM372301", "GSM372295", "GSM372297", "GSM1432949", "GSM1432961", "GSM1432964", "GSM1432981", "GSM1432969", "GSM372293", "GSM1432960", "GSM372292", "GSM1432978", "GSM372286", "GSM372289", "GSM372299", "GSM1432976", "GSM1432944", "GSM1432951", "GSM1432954", "GSM1432979", "GSM372291", "GSM372296", "GSM372288", "GSM1432962", "GSM372305", "GSM372304"], "supplementary_files": [{"type": "TAR (of CEL)", "name": "GSE59294_RAW.tar"}], "status": "Public on Dec 04 2014", "contributor": "Hamilton JD, Su\u00e1rez-Fari\u00f1as M, Guttman-Yasky E", "scrap_date": {"$date": 1434625298998}, "summary": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease, with high unmet need for new therapies that are safe for chronic use.

Our diagnostic evaluation for the presence of coronary artery disease relies on functional testing, which detects flow-limiting coronary stenosis, but we have known for decades that most lesions underlying AMI are only of mild to moderate luminal narrowings, not obstructing coronary blood flow.

sellar/suprasellar region. Despite a high survival rate with current surgical and radiation therapy (75-95% at 10 years), ACP is associated with debilitating visual, endocrine, neurocognitive and psychological morbidity, resulting in exceptionally poor quality of life for survivors. Identification of an effective pharmacological therapy would drastically decrease morbidity and improve long term outcomes for children with ACP.", "meta": {"geo_id": 68015}, "type": ["Expression profiling by array", "Third-party reanalysis"], "submission_date": {"$date": 1429228800000}, "last_update_date": {"$date": 1429315200000}}]
